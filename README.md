# Observational-Equivalence-and-Security-Games
Observational Equivalence and Security Games in Tamarin. 
We combine the security game in the security notions of encryption schemes to construct security games under the symbolic model using observational equivalence, which in turn can be utilized to automate the detection of the security of encryption schemes under the symbolic model. Further, we purposefully construct some encryption schemes
that satisfy different security properties and then test them using our constructed games, and the results show the correctness of our security games. Finally, by analyzing a key agreement protocol and replacing theencryption schemes in it, our experimental results lead to the conclusion that
ignoring the adversaryâ€™s knowledge of encryption schemes as well as ignoring the the types of attack allow can have an impact on the results of the formal analysis of the protocol.
